    "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks that are particularly well suited to processing sequential data such as text. They are able to store past information in memory and process it at a later time. This is in contrast to feedforward neural networks, which do not have memory and can only process the current input."

The hidden state is initialized to a vector of zeros, $h_0 = 0$. The hidden state at the previous time step, $h_{t-1}$, is used to compute the hidden state at the current time step, $h_t$. The hidden state at the current time step, $h_t$, is used to compute the output at the current time step, $y_t$. The output at the current time step, $y_t$, is used to compute the loss at the current time step, $l_t$. The loss at each time step is summed to compute the total loss for the entire sequence.\n"
